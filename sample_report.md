Here are some examples of what you can produce.

### Choropleths

#### See which states have higher insurance acceptance at vaccine providers. Note that covid vaccinations are free, but the same providers might charge for flu shots. We look forward to adding flu vaccine data to our dashboard in the future.

#### How convenient is it to get a vaccine? Some states have more providers that allow walk-ins without an appointment than others.

### Rankings
#### Look at what vaccines are more commonly in stock in different states. Have a young child in need of vaccination? Looks like the Pfizer vaccine for 5-11 year olds is still rolling out with fewer providers having it on hand.

#### Alaska's vaccine providers seem to have it more though! Time for a winter cruise?
