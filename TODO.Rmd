## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

# choropleth on availability filter by vaccine type
# add flu vaccine dataset and merge into our covid dataset
# add this as a tab to show future development
# add generate report tab which takes user input and creates graphs from it
# convert about into a rmd file which should produce a r
# use user zip
# add filters (zip, state, vaccine type, in stock)
# add graphs
#   what vaccines are in stock
#      by type
#   what zip/state has most in stock
# add css for popup in stock and maybe others (data table)
# marker indicates availability based on view
# display count of providers
# add file upload/fetch latest data
# compare historical data against current (time series)
# add different output types (tufte, ppt, etc) https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/tufte-handouts.html
# cleanup files - remove vaccines.R, move into R folder, etc
# Test if stuff works from beginning
# test data from another day
# clear filters
# help text info for needing pdflatex to create pdf report
# make git repo public
# add legend to map?
# use us_map https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/usmap/vignettes/mapping.html
# upload datasets/read latest
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
